<p>G'day<br>
I'm abovewater. I want to learn a tangible skill and that's why I'm working my way through FCC. On of the porblems that I've identified with my current career is that it doesn't set you up for success if you move on. By using FCC and other resources, I'm going to set myself up for success. <br>
<h2>What does that mean?</h2>
Well, in short, I'll be documenting my learning here as a way to hold myself accountable to you.
